Objectives : 

- [ ] Sort alphabetically (what i do now) and reverse-alphabetically
- [ ] Sort by date
- [ ] "Not posting on ? social"
- [ ] Setup (Choosing SD folder, user preferences etc.. etc..)
- [ ] Better way to choose images (possibly use image-similarity to identify similar images and treat them automatically as batch)
- [ ] Keyboard-driven UI
- [ ] Togglable Keyboard hints
- [ ] maybe? try chakra ui or some other better UI component, even if it will be a pain in the ass
- [ ] more social options, dynamically adjust for more social options
- [ ] better ui when scaled smaller
- [ ] add a badge for when "today's images" actually found any unclassified images
- [ ] put the filters buttons in an accordion menu / putting them on a separate sidebar (e.g. in the bottom left)
- [ ] Automatic NSFW detection through [this classifier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hysts/DeepDanbooru)
  - [ ] NSFW filtering
- [ ] Post to ... function. 
  - Will let the user select a group of images, watermarked or not, and copy them to a temporary folder. The folder will be then opened so the user can easily post them on their chosen service. While he does that, during the folder opening, the entries of the images in the app will have already set the "posted on ..." flag to true. Multiple ones if multiple services were selected.
  - idea : instead of checkmarks, i can change the card color to make it more obvious about which card is selected and which is not.
- [ ] thumbnail size selector (sm md lg) / automatic size switching with window resizing





- Possibility to have a single software for both artists and AI things. might look into it.
