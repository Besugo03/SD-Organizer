# Paw-Fect
A tool for managing, watermarking, posting and viewing your images.
Intended to be used for image editing/posting in general, even though the pipeline mainly comes from stable-diffusion generations since it's what i know.
Made with Electron (so it can run kinda everywhere), love and pre-made components.
